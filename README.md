'County_yield_PCA.zip' contains a shapefile for US Midwest county level corn yields, acreage, %GM acreage, and scores from principal component analysis (conducted on yield). The data are identified by the following: Y'YYYY' - county level corn yield by year, A'YYYY' - county level corn acreage by year, SPEI'YYYY' - SPEI index averaged for the growing season (May-Sept) by year, PCA'#' - scores pertaining to principal component (#), and PCA_detrended'#' - socres pertaining to principal components after detrending for GM crop use.

'corn_AA2_2.pro' is an IDL script file used to conduct the principal component analysis. Principal component analyis can also easily be conducted in other programming languages such as Matlab or R.
