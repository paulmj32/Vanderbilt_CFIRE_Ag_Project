# Vanderbilt_CFIRE_Ag_Project

*Ag_Project_03.R* is the master script. Change the working directory (line 11) to the cloned (downloaded) repository location on your machine, and run the script. *corn_yld.R*, *gm_corn.R*, *pca_yld.R*, *quintile_diff.R*, *spei_ncdf.R*, and *corn_acre.R* are all functions referenced within *Ag_Project_03.R*. *Figure_X.R* can be run to produce figures presented in the paper after running the master script. 

*causal_impact_ag2.R* conducts the Bayesian Structural Time Series Analysis and creates the corresponding tables and figures. It can be run independently from *Ag_Project_03.R*.
